# DataVisualization
R,Tableau and Python

Have used Two dataset for Data Visualization.
One Dataset is hotel booking demand from Kaggle, have used Tableau for insights.
This dataset describes two hotel one is Resort Hotel and other is City hotel. Both shares the same structure with 31 variables. Both the dataset comprehend bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including the bookings that effectively arrived  and bookings that were cancelled(ScienceDirect Full Text PDF, 2018).
The data set has many interesting variables apart from Cancellations and reservations like Region from where customers are booking, Arrival Month, Repeated Customers, Meal Preferences, Leadtime (Advance Bookings), Deposit Type, Customer Type, Segment(Online or Group bookings). With this dataset will be able to perform an exploratory analysis on what basis bookings and cancellations are made, which will help the Hotel Management to increase their revenue and will be able to make predictions on cancellations.

Another dataset is IPL dataset from kaggle, have used Rstudion and plotly for animation.
Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by fifteen teams representing different cities in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008.
For IPL, players are selected on auction basis. In that way a franchise can choose the best players from the best performed team. Franchise from Mumbai city in India are new to this field and they do not have much knowledge on what factors they need to choose the team therefore they wanted to analyze the overall performance of the teams in last 12 years, for which they wanted a help of Visual Designer who can help them in exploring the performance of the team previous matches. The major feature to focus on would be to analyze:
•	Which team won highest number of times
•	How is the team in hitting boundaries (6’s and 4’s)
•	What is the win percentage overall for each team
•	How Mumbai team has performed against other teams
•	How is the performance of the team in each season overall etc. 
As a Visual Designer, I will be able to benefit the Franchise company by providing useful insights
